# Trash_detection_Yolov10_StreamLit

To address your observation about lower model confidence detecting better, this is a common trade-off in object detection. Lower confidence thresholds will indeed detect more objects, but they may also increase false positives. Higher confidence thresholds will be more selective, potentially missing some objects but with higher certainty in the detections it does make.
